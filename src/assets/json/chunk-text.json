    "banner": "HARVEST-Vision: International Workshop on Applications of CV and HPC in Agriculture",
    "about": "We invite original research contributions at the intersection of computer vision (CV)/artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), and precision agriculture, including but not limited to: (1) Domain adaptation and generalization for agricultural vision tasks (across geographies, crops, seasons, and sensing modalities); (2) Vision-language alignment, multimodal and low-resource learning for agricultural datasets; (3) Explainable and interpretable AI for field robotics and decision support in agriculture; (4) Spatiotemporal analytics and edge/in-situ deployment for precision agriculture; (5) Novel dataset creation, benchmarking, and evaluation methodologies in real-world or remote sensing agricultural settings; (6) Robust perception and prediction methods for quality control, phenotyping, livestock, or resource management. We accept full-length papers (5–8 pages, WACV template, intended for publication in WACV’s workshop proceedings). Accepted contributions will be presented as orals or posters. All submissions should use the official WACV template and be submitted via the CMT link on the workshop website. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by our program committee for technical quality and relevance."
